LunaNES is an NES emulator written in go. It is fully functional with mapper 0 with more mappers soon to be developed. Currently the emulator does not support sound. The current configuration of the emulator recieves input from a USB NES controller, the controllers VID and PID will be needed to ensure LunaNES connects to the correct device.


### Currently supported mappers
- [Mapper 0](https://nesdir.github.io/mapper0.html)
- Mapper 1 (planned)
- Mapper 2 (works with some games)
- Mapper 4 (kinda works)
